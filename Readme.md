** BreakingBad SwiftUI iOS App **

This app demonstrates a simple SwiftUI app displaying some data from a remote API.

It loads in characters from the BreakingBadAPI.

- You can like a character which is persisted locally on device.
- You can view the detail of a character and read quotes attributed to the character.
- You can create a review of the character which implements some form validation. You won't be able to save your review as that server part is not implemented.

It demos both Combine and async/await implementations.

Some unit and functional UI tests has been added.
